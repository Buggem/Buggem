### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am software developer who knows very little about hardware. I am familliar with JavaScript and all the (client side) web related programming languages. I also seldom use Python, C, and Bash.

I am currently learning **C** with **Emscripten**.

My most recent project I have been working on a port of a port of Linuxxdoom, which you may have heard of. You can now play it online [here](https://buggem.github.io/sdl_doom_em), for free. Also, check out the code [here](https://github.com/Buggem/sdl_doom_em) if you want to learn about the ~~labor~~ hard work I put into this project
