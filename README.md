### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am software developer who knows very little (nothing at all) about hardware. My main languages are JavaScript, Java, Python, and _**sometimes**_ Bash.


Most recently I have been learning about how a GameBoy works, and espicially took interest in the video display, which lead me to create the [GameBoy Display Developement Toolchain](https://github.com/Buggem/gbddt), a project designed for reading Hexadecimal data as 'tiles'.
